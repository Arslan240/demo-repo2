#Trying to create a repository directly from with in the vscode

And yes.

1- git init = git initialized -> this command will create an empty repository in the github for us.

2- Once we have created the repository locally we need to create it on github. We can create it manually from github.

3- After creating the repository on github you need to copy the ssh link and then use the following command.
    *--> git remote add origin <url>

4- git remoter -v = this command will tell you all the repositories connected to the current one.
